Problem Statement:

Customer Behaviour and its prediction lies at the core of every Business Model. From Stock Exchange, e-Commerce and Automobile to even Presidential Elections, predictions serve a great purpose. Most of these predictions are based on the data available about a person’s activity either online or in-person
Recommendation Engines are the much-needed manifestations of the desired Predictability of User Activity. Recommendation Engines move one step further and not only give information but put forth strategies to further increase users’ interaction with the platform.
In today’s world OTT platform and Streaming Services have taken up a big chunk in the Retail and Entertainment industry. Organizations like Netflix, Amazon etc. analyse User Activity Pattern’s and suggest products that better suit the user needs and choices.


Project Objective:

We will be creating one such Recommendation Engine from the ground-up, where every single user, based on their area of interest and ratings, would be recommended a list of movies that are best suited for them.
